  "description": "Oversized, bright 1 bedroom on the 15th floor with uninterrupted views to the Empire State Building and Hudson Yards. The unit faces the center of the block, minimizing traffic noise. 5 large closets provide ample storage, and north-facing wall-to-wall casement windows plus white oak floors throughout bring in and reflect light without the heat. Less than 15 minutes from Union Square, NYU, Facebook, and Google, the building is clean and quiet, 90% owner-occupied, and in the heart of all the food, nightlife, and culture that makes the East Village so sought after. Maintenance, HOA, and taxes inclusive are $1948 / month (of which 2/3rds are tax deductible).",
