  "description": "112 West 13th Street is a rare offering: a 20-foot-wide, five-story Greek Revival townhouse built in 1844, set on a beautiful tree-lined block in the heart of Greenwich Village. With its stoop, bay windows, and multiple terraces overlooking a lush private garden , the home radiates the charm and character that define the Village at its most timeless. The house extends across five full floors plus a finished roof deck , and includes an extension on three levels, offering a remarkable scale of indoor and outdoor living for this prime location. A wide brownstone stoop leads into a gracious foyer and on to a magnificent double parlor , distinguished by soaring ceilings, original plasterwork, and ornate pocket doors inset with antique glass. The south-facing bay windows draw in light throughout the day, while the rear parlor opens to a private deck with tranquil views over the deep, landscaped garden — a setting of mature trees and flowering shrubs that feels like a secret park in the middle of downtown. On the upper floors, multiple terraces extend the living space outdoors and frame garden vistas. A skylit artist’s studio crowns the home on the fifth floor, leading to a rooftop deck with open views of the Empire State Building and the city skyline. This magical perch, along with the garden below, makes the home equally suited for intimate retreats or large gatherings. Over the years, the townhouse has been a haven for creativity and a backdrop for a vibrant social life. International artists, filmmakers, and musicians have called it home. Opportunities of this caliber — a historic Greek Revival townhouse with width, depth, and a large garden in one of the most sought-after neighborhoods in the world — are exceedingly rare. 112 West 13th Street offers the chance to own a piece of New York history, while reimagining it for the next generation.",
