  "description": "West-Facing Three Bedroom Condo in Greenwich Village  Nestled just a stone’s throw from iconic Washington Square Park, this expansive corner loft at 173 MacDougal Street is a rare three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom residence in the heart of historic Greenwich Village. Spanning over 2,250 square feet with southwest and northern exposures, the home is bathed in natural light and framed by serene garden views through 10 oversized windows. Tucked away on a tranquil residential block, the sun-filled, open-concept living room is anchored by a wood-burning fireplace and flows seamlessly to a private terrace —offering a peaceful retreat and a rare blend of indoor-outdoor living. Interiors by CeCe Barfield Inc. feature a remodeled kitchen with a Bluestar oven, custom-built storage, concealed drinks fridge, re-tiled primary bath, curated wallpaper, and a reimagined fireplace mantel. High ceilings and refined finishes complete the space. Originally built in 1890 as a Romanesque Revival structure and converted to an intimate eight-unit condominium in 2008, 173 MacDougal Street offers boutique living with prewar charm and modern comfort. Amenities include doorman service (Monday–Friday, 8 am–6 pm), virtual doorman coverage 24/7, key-fob secured elevator access, and private storage. Located just half a block from Washington Square Park yet remarkably quiet, this address offers exceptional access to the city’s top dining, shopping, cultural institutions, and transportation via West 4th Street Station—delivering the best of downtown living with a rare sense of calm.",
