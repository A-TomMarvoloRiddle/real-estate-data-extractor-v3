  "description": "At nearly 1,600 square feet, Residence 4CD at 250 West 15th Street is a rare downtown home where architectural detail and thoughtful design come together at the intersection of Chelsea, the West Village and Meatpacking District. This two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment has been reimagined with a modern sensibility that emphasizes clean lines, natural light, and bespoke finishes throughout. With an impressive 40 feet of frontage — the width of two townhouses — the spacious living room makes a lasting impression with its concrete feature wall and wood-burning fireplace, an unexpected combination that lends the space both texture and warmth. Custom millwork and shelving add refinement, while a series of five windows fill the room with northern light and frame treetop views over quiet, residential 15th Street. The dining area and kitchen form a seamless extension of the living space, featuring fully integrated appliances by Liebherr and Wolf, minimalist cabinetry, and a sculptural concrete island that doubles as a gathering point. The primary suite offers a generous walk-in closet that functions equally well as a dressing room, home office, or nursery. Its en-suite bathroom evokes a spa-like calm, complete with radiant heated floors and a towel warmer. The duplex layout provides separation and privacy for the secondary bedroom, tucked into the trees with sunny southern exposures and its own full bath — perfect as a private bedroom, guest suite, or quiet home office. Originally built as five adjoining townhouses, 250 West 15th Street has evolved into a boutique elevator cooperative while maintaining its sense of scale and character. Recent building updates include a redesigned lobby and refreshed hallways, with the added convenience of a live-in superintendent and laundry room. Located on a tree-lined block at the nexus of Chelsea, the West Village, and Meatpacking, the address offers a quiet residential feel with immediate access to the city’s best restaurants, shopping, and cultural destinations. Transit is unbeatable, with the A, C, E, L, 1, 2, 3, F, and M subway lines all within a block, along with convenient M11 and M14 bus service. Pets, pied-à-terre, co-purchasing, gifting, and guarantors are all welcome.",
