  "description": "SUN-SPLASHED  &  RENOVATED, DREAMY DUPLEX w/ WORKING FIREPLACE & CENTRAL AC Supremely located and superbly unique, this renovated home is immensely livable and lovable. Bright, South-facing and pin-drop quiet, this dreamy, renovated, sun-filled duplex is a stand-out residence for all the right reasons.  Offering high ceilings that soar to over 10-feet, big, quiet, sun-splashed rooms, two newly-redone full baths, exposed brick , a wood-burning fireplace and central ac, this is the fresh and inviting, upgraded residence that feels like a real house — a real home.  Upstairs is the lofty living room with its three big, southerly windows, and its wonderful working fireplace. This is the entertaining floor and it offers a full, open dining room, foyer, a full, custom guest bath, and an upgraded kitchen with stainless appliances and good counter/cabinet space.  Down the straight-stairway is a bonus den /media/guest area and an office space – a bit of extra with over 10-foot ceilings — a flexible gateway to the king-sized bedroom and the big guest bedroom. Both bright, quiet bedrooms offer big South-facing windows, good closet space (the primary has a huge walk-in closet!), and are well served by a full, renovated, bath.  Sweetly situated in the peaceful and bright back of its historic building (former piano factory), this delightful, pet-friendly, unique residence offers sublime proximity to downtown’s most coveted shopping, dining, and cultural destinations – not to mention a plethora of easy transportation options (1, C, E, F, and M as well as M23). The building super lives nearby, and close to home are Madison Square Park, Eataly, Chelsea Market, Chelsea Piers, Little Island, Whole Foods, Fairway, Trader Joe’s, and the freshly refurbished Chelsea Hotel.  Beautiful, practical, unique and convenient, your renovated, sun-splashed, dreamy duplex — with working fireplace and central ac — awaits.  2% flip tax paid by purchaser. Transfer includes private storage area.",
