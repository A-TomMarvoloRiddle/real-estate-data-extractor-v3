  "description": "This thoughtfully renovated Gramercy pre-war triplex home has style to spare, and features you don't normally find at this price. Just one flight up in an intimate pre-war walk-up co-op, you'll enter the home's lower level. There you'll pass by the half bath with a washer/dryer, two closets, and a good-sized kitchen with a 4-burner Bertazzoni gas stove and oven and a Liebherr refrigerator (a dishwasher may be added with board approval). Climb a few stairs and you're on the middle, main level. You'll be impressed by the 10'3\" ceilings, a dramatic working wood-burning fireplace, hardwood floors, a transom window, and french doors that open to a balcony facing north, over back gardens. The room easily accommodates both living and dining areas. The upper level, with 8' ceilings, is the home of the private sleeping loft and the primary bathroom. This includes a walk-in shower and an interior transom window to let in additional light. Air conditioning throughout is provided by a discreet free-standing unit, though through-wall options may be added with board approval. 133 East 15th Street is a pet-friendly 14 unit co-op built in 1900, with video intercom security. It's close to shopping, Union Square and Gramercy Park; and easily accessible to the 4/5/6, N/Q/R/W, and L trains, several bus lines, and CitiBike stations. Pied-a-terres, guarantors, co-purchasing, parents buying for children, and subletting after two years of residency are permissible with board approval. 1.5% Flip Tax paid by seller.",
