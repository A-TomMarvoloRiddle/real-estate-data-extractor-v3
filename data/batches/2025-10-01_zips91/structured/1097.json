  "description": "For additional perspective on this home, be sure to watch the video. First Showings will be Sunday, Oct 5th.   Right in the heart of New York is Washington Square Park, a neighborhood gathering place cherished for its vibrant energy and artistic legacy. Here, on its 100th anniversary, is 32 Washington Square West, one of the premier full service downtown prewar cooperatives.   Within, we find this thoughtfully renovated 7 room, 3 bedroom, 3 bath home; where great attention was placed on every detail. Upon entering, you're struck by the streams of sun and light provided from innumerable outward facing windows and four exposures .   As you traverse the commodious double-wide living space , you're seduced, and recognize that you're actually, tranquilly, hovering over the park itself. It's vibrancy sweetly softened by the trees and the high floor. These open North, East and South exposures keep you inspired throughout the day, whether your relaxing in the living room, cooking dinner in the open chef's kitchen with top of the line appliances and center island, dining and entertaining, tending to the days tasks or even retiring for the evening. This home further features, traditional moldings, stunning hardwood floors, and a working gas fireplace; there's also central air-conditioning and your own private washer and dryer and storage unit. & nbsp;   All of this is captured in this classic prewar cooperative in the heart of legendary Greenwich Village, a neighborhood which defines what it means to live among the art, culture, history and the here and now of New York City. & nbsp; The building was built in 1925 and is a full service building which includes a 24-hour doorman, live-in super, storage space and a gym. This home is accompanied with its own private storage unit as well. Pets are allowed. & nbsp; The & nbsp; flip tax is 2% of the purchase price paid by the purchaser.   Welcome home!",
