    "description": "Storybook rooflineTranquil fountainOrnate plasterworkEuropean country estateLaundry centerBeautifully carved winding staircaseGrand entry foyer\n\nA rare chance to own one of New York City's last truly remarkable, architecturally significant townhouses. Rich with history and character, this Gramercy Park gem stands out as one of the most storied private residences in the country.\n\nThe home's origins are as unique as its design. First built in 17th-century Amsterdam by affluent Dutch owners, it was carefully dismantled and shipped to Manhattan in 1845, initially finding a home on the Upper West Side. In 1910, it was moved once again, this time to its current location, where it was reimagined by celebrated English architect Frederick J. Sterner. Commissioned by sugar magnate Joseph B. Thomas, the home became known as the Joseph B. Thomas House. Since then, it has remained strikingly intact, most recently owned by a world-famous fashion designer and philanthropist. For decades, it hosted iconic parties and served as a creative salon for some of society's most influential women.\n\nThe exterior is a dramatic showcase of Gothic Revival style, with bold stained-glass windows on every level, intricate stone detailing, and a distinctive, storybook roofline. Massive carved wooden doors open into nearly 7,000 square feet across four floors plus a mezzanine, offering both grandeur and a sense of intimacy.\n\nInside, the home makes a lasting impression from the moment you step into the grand entry foyer, where a classic Flemish stone floor sets the tone. The showpiece is the \"Italian Room,\" as named by Sterner himself, an awe-inspiring space with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, ornate plasterwork, paneled walls, and a monumental stone fireplace. A glass-roofed solarium just beyond fills the home with natural light and greenery, anchored by a tranquil fountain.\n\nDownstairs, a wine cellar and tasting room provide a hidden, atmospheric retreat. The formal dining room evokes a European country estate, wrapped in warm wood paneling; perfect for anything from intimate dinners to lavish entertaining.\n\nUpstairs, the current layout includes six bedrooms and six bathrooms, with ample room to reconfigure into luxurious suites, dressing rooms, or staff quarters. A beautifully carved winding staircase connects each level. Additional features include a chef's kitchen, a prep kitchen, laundry center, dumbwaiter, and both formal and service staircases.\n\nThoughtfully crafted renovation plans are available for review. This is a rare, once-in-a-generation opportunity to own a home with unmatched history, architectural integrity, and transformative potential.\n\nLocated in the heart of the famed Gramercy Park neighborhood, you are just moments away from the best dining, shopping, and entertainment Manhattan has to offer.\n\nShow more\n\n**60 days**on Zillow\\|**8,954**views\\|**480**saves\\|\n\nListing by:\n\n**Douglas Elliman** **212-641-0096,**\n\nEleonora Srugo\n\nSource: StreetEasy,MLS#: S1782630",
