## What's special

Nestled on a picturesque, tree-lined block in the heart of Gramercy, this stunning four-story single-family townhouse offers over 5,000 square feet of elegant living space. Seamlessly blending timeless architecture with contemporary comforts, this home is designed for sophisticated everyday living and effortless entertaining. With generously proportioned rooms, multiple private outdoor spaces, and a versatile floor plan, this thoughtfully updated home perfectly suits a modern, flexible lifestyle.

First Floor
A glass-enclosed entry foyer welcomes you into a bright, spacious breakfast room complete with a cozy wood-burning fireplace and abundant natural light. Beyond lies the expansive chef’s kitchen, featuring custom white cabinetry, a large island, and top-of-the-line appliances. Adjacent to the kitchen, the formal dining room—with custom built-in storage—opens directly onto a beautifully landscaped private garden, creating an ideal setting for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings. A convenient powder room completes this level.

Parlor Floor
The parlor level impresses with soaring 12-foot ceilings, elegant moldings, and oversized windows that flood the space with natural light. The formal living room, situated at the front of the home, is anchored by a stately marble fireplace, while a secondary area at the rear offers a cozy, informal living space. This floor is perfectly suited for both grand entertaining and quiet evenings at home.

Third Floor
The serene primary suite occupies the entire third floor, offering a spacious bedroom, a luxurious en-suite bathroom, and generous closet space. The spa-like bath features double vanities, an oversized soaking tub, a separate shower, and a versatile bonus area—used variously as an exercise nook with a Peloton bike or an additional vanity space. Completing this level is a small terrace overlooking the back of the home.

Fourth Floor
The top floor offers two additional well-proportioned bedrooms, each with ample light and storage, along with a full bathroom and laundry room. This level also provides flexibility for use as guest accommodations, a playroom, or a library/home office. A grand interior staircase connects all four levels of the home.

Garden Level
The garden level provides an additional bedroom and full bathroom, along with a recreation or fitness room and kitchenette. With its own private entrance at street level and easily separated from the rest of the house, this space is perfectly suited for guest accommodations, an accessory apartment, or live-in staff.

Additional Features
With its historic façade, elegant interiors, and prime Gramercy location just moments from Union Square, Irving Place, and some of Manhattan’s best dining, shopping, and cultural amenities, 113 East 19th Street is a rare townhouse offering in one of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods.
