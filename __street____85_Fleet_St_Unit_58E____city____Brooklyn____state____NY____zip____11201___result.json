    "description": "Immediate occupancy. Designed by award-winning SHoP Architects, residence 58E is a generously proportioned 810 SF south-facing one bedroom, one bathroom home with ceiling heights up to 11 feet. Expansive floor to ceiling windows let in an abundance of natural light, framing sweeping views over Brooklyn, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Interiors by Gachot Studios feature European White-Oak floors with a custom honey stain, bronze accents, and rich mahogany millwork, creating a sense of warmth, sophistication and timelessness. The kitchen boasts expressive Absolute Black stone counter-tops, oil-rubbed bronze fixtures by Waterworks and fully integrated high-end Miele appliances. Large format Honed Breccia Capria marble in the primary bathroom serves as a statement of natural artistry, with its unique patterns and irregularities adding richness and individuality. An in-home stacked Miele washer and dryer offers added convenience.
